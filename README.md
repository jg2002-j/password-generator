# Challenge 4: Password Generator
## Overview
You'll create an app that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS, all powered by JavaScript code that you will write. Your app will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include special characters. If youâ€™re unfamiliar with these, see this list of Password Special Characters from the OWASP Foundation.

Before you begin, download your starter code for this Challenge and unzip the zip file.
